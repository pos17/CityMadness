# **SOLI VAGANT**

## INTRODUCTION
Project developed for the course "Creative Programming and Computing", held in the Master degree of [Music and Acoustic Engineering](https://suono.polimi.it/), based in [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/). 
  The project aims at providing to the user a different way to explore a city map, using visual and sound feedbacks to guide it towards interesting points of the city

### Aim of the project
The Soli Vagant artistic installation aims to create an interactive experience based on features retrieved from real city data. These features combined with an user's input (where they want to go) create a multimodal artistic representation of the city. The project is divided in two main parts: the visual feedback which is a particle system where all the particles move as independent agents following the paths imposed by the city's streets and the path followed by the user. On regards the installation's sound design, the data sonification pursues to associate a chord progression to the user's path choices through an L-System. The soundscape gives to the user hints on how close it is to an interest point of the city, the closer it get, the clearer the soundscape becomes.
